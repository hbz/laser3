# How to customize CSS

Our custom themes and the default theme override the *.less in 'src/definitions'. The folder 'src/side' is not used yet.


## Theming

- we got the themes 'laser' and 'accessibility'
- all changes in css we make by changing inside the theme!
- the original semantic ui file for gulp bilding 'app/semantic/tasks/build.js' is changed in order to build two themes at the same time (laser & accessibility)
- meanwile the gulp build process temp files are builded and moved around

## Example

I would like to change the padding between an icon and content in a list

1.) find the variable in default theme. In this case there

    src/themes/default/elements/list.variables

2.) create the list.variables in the laser theme folder

    src/themes/laser/elements/list.variables

3.) change the specifig variable only there

4.) Change the theme.config

    /files/frontend/semantic/src/definitions/themes/laser/theme.config

    /files/frontend/semantic/src/definitions/themes/accessibility/theme.config

old:

    @list       : 'default';

new:

    @list       : 'laser';

5.) Build css

    cd semantic
    gulp build
